KDLP proc module

This module will create an entry in `/proc` that holds a fixed message for all users to read.

The file will show up in `/proc` as a file named kdlp.

The file will be owned by user root and group root.

The permissions for the file will be 0444 (read only for owner/group/others).

Operations:
	- Read:
		user will read from /proc a fixed message "bashar-osama love linux"
		when reads a file in /proc:- the string is generated on the fly
		interacting with file position:- reading x bytes will advance the file position by x.
		edge cases:- seq_read is the helper function that is called upon when read syscall is invoked, it handles
		all the edge cases gracfully inside the kernel, and copies the data to user buffer etc...
		copy_to_user is the safe function used within seq_read that gracfully handles any nested intterupts
		without crashing the kernel and provides an error indication to the calling function
		so the kernel can propagate the error to the user
		describe what value will be returned:- On success, the number of bytes read is returned
		(zero indicates end of file), On error, -ERROR_NUMBER is returned.
	- Write:
		no permission to write.
	- Seek: the seek user interface for a seq_file is the same as normal file so using it is not
		any different. the signature lseek function is off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence)
